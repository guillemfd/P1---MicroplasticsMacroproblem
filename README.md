# P1---MicroplasticsMacroproblem
First project @ Ironhack

This is my firs project at Ironhack WebDev academy.
Just learning how to code while having fun!

Developing a video game after just a couple of weeks learning to code has been quite challenging but completely worth it.
Proud and satisfied with my attempt 😊 but in any case feel free to give me your feedback and let me know how to improve!

In addition, I am taking advantadge of the project to create an awareness about the microplastics problem in our oceans. 🐠 🐟 🐡 🐬 🐳
